            </p>
            <p>
              The Policy covers accidents or occurrences while the Renter or an Authorized Driver is operating the vehicle listed on The Policy, for the coverage provided by The Policy and for which you have paid a premium. In addition, The Policy covers accidents or occurrences while the vehicle listed on The Policy is occupied but not under operation, for the coverage provided by The Policy and for which you have paid a premium. Coverage will include: for units 15 years old or newer Comprehensive and Collision with a (Policy Deductible) deductible per occurrence and for motorized units only bodily injury and property damage liability, (Policy Liability Limit), on an excess basis. This is the Underlying Liability coverage offered through The Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              If The Policy is cancelled at your request prior to taking possession of the RV rental, there will be no minimum earned premium retained by the insurer for this insurance. However, if this insurance is cancelled at your request after taking possession of the RV rental, the premium will be fully earned and retained by the insurer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Policy does not offer nor cover You, or anyone using the RV, for Uninsured, Underinsured or Uninsured/Underinsured Motorists Bodily Injury or Property Damage, Medical Payments Coverage or Personal Injury Protection or any other coverage not noted above. The named insured has rejected all coverage other than the coverage defined and offered for purchase herein and as a purchaser of coverage under The Policy you expressly agree to the selection and rejections made by the named insured under The Policy. However, The Policy may comply with individual state specific requirements. If an accident, to which The Policy applies, occurs in any state or province other than the one in which The Policy is written, we will interpret The Policy coverage for the Accident or occurrence as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
              If the state or province has a financial responsibility, compulsory insurance or similar law requiring a driver using a recreational vehicle in that state or province to maintain insurance with limits of liability for bodily injury or property damage higher than the limits The Policy provides, then the limits of liability under The Policy that will apply to that accident will be the higher Minimum Liability Coverage limits required by the law in that state or province or the applicable limits of liability provided for that insured under The Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Policy’s coverage territory is the United States. There is no coverage for accidents occurring in Mexico.
            </p>
            <p>
              By purchasing this insurance, you expressly agree that you understand and agree that coverages are limited as set forth above and that the intent of The Policy that you selected to purchase coverage under is to provide Liability coverage to third parties who may be injured by your operation of the RV and to provide Comprehensive and Collision coverage for the RV you have rented.
            </p>
            <p>

However, in the event that the owner does not complete the Departure and Return forms, as supplied by Company, within 48 hours after the end of term in which the loss occurred, then any damages paid out of The Policy will be reduced by 200% of the applicable deductible listed on the Declarations Page up to a maximum of $3,000. The Policy will not pay for a loss which is not reported within 10 days after the end of the rental term in which the loss occurred.

            </p>
            <p>
              In the event that a Renter initiates a chargeback with their credit card company for the insurance premium charge, Insurer will use commercially reasonable efforts to dispute the validity of the chargeback. Owner and Renter agree to cooperate with the Insurer and to provide any information that may be reasonably requested by the Insurer in its investigation. Owner and Renter authorize the Insurer to share information about a chargeback with Company, the Renter, the Renter’s financial institution, the Owner, and the Owner’s financial institution in order to investigate or mediate a Chargeback. Renter acknowledges that chargeback decisions are made by the applicable issuing bank, Card Networks, or NACHA and all judgments as to the validity of the chargeback are made at the sole discretion of the applicable issuing bank, card networks, or NACHA.

            <p>
              The fees you see listed below are related to any post-rental resolution between the Owner and the Renter. Failure to charge any of the fees below shall not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise the same in the event another fee should become due at any other time. More information about the Post-Trip Fee Policy can be found in the help center.
            </p>
            <p>
              Administrative Fee. Company shall charge the Renter an administrative fee on any charges listed by the Owner on the Return form (identified as overages, charges, damages).
            </p>
            <p>
              Late Fee. If a Renter returns the RV after the agreed rental period end time, such Renter will be charged a late fee. This late fee is calculated by combining an administrative fee to the prorated hourly rental rate (based on the daily rate for the RV rented). If the late return results in the disruption of another rental or Company needs to find the owner of the RV alternative transportation due to the late return, the Renter will pay the full daily rate for every eight (8) hours the RV is late. These charges will be added to the initial rental rate agreed upon by the Owner and Renter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cleaning Fee. We understand that RVs get dirty out on the road. Returning an RV with a normal amount of dirt is acceptable and will not result in any additional charges. However if an RV is returned covered in dirt, soot, trash, food, wine stains, etc, and you, as Renter, do not clean the RV prior to returning it, the Owner may charge the Renter, possibly through Company, an additional cleaning fee. These fees may vary for each Owner.
            </p>
            <p>
              No-Show Fee. If the Owner does not show up to meet the Renter and make the RV available for the Renter at the agreed upon rental start time, Company will treat this as an Owner cancellation. If a Renter does contact the Company to cancel the rental, the Renter will be charged the total amount for the rental period until the issue is resolved. If the Renter does not show to pick up the RV, it will be treated as a Renter cancellation and subject to the Owner’s cancellation policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Refueling Fee. Renters should check with the Owner to discuss their fuel options and miscellaneous charges before the rental begins. The RV’s gas tank and propane tanks should be full when you pick it up, but be sure to discuss expectations and options. The typical refueling options that our Owners offer are:
            </p>
            <ul
              className="policy-content-list"
            >
              <li>
                The Owner includes fuel with the rental (not very common).
              </li>
              <li>
                The Renter refuels the RV prior to the end of the rental and returns it with the same amount of fuel at the time of pickup. If the rented RV is not refueled upon return, the Owner will send the Company the receipt. The amount will be charged to the Renter plus an administrative fee.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              RV Damage. A $150 fee will be incurred for stranding an RV (in addition to any costs incurred to repair the RV). In the case of any damage to the RV (fiberglass, cushions, cabinetry, electronics, etc.), the Renter will be charged the actual cost of parts plus hourly labor costs needed to repair the damaged item. The amount will be charged to the Renter plus an administrative fee.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lost Item Fee. Any lost or damaged items will be valued at Good Sams or Amazons Internet retail pricing for comparable item(s). The amount must be claimed on the Damage Form and will be charged to the Renter plus an administrative fee.

            </ul>
            <p>
              Renter will be required to agree to the cancellation policy selected by the Owner. Any Renter who wishes to cancel their booking must submit a cancellation request through the Vancation platform. The cancellation request will be processed according to the Owner’s chosen cancellation policy which the Renter previously agreed to.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to receive any type of refund, cancellations must be made by 11:59pm PST on the day set forth in the applicable cancellation policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              For all bookings made seven (7) or more days prior to the rental start date, there is an eight (8) hour grace cancellation period wherein the Renter will be entitled to a refund of all monies paid.
            </p>
            <p>
              For all bookings made less than seven (7) days prior to the rental start date, there is only a one (1)-hour grace cancellation grace period wherein the Renter will be entitled to a refund of all monies paid. Once the rental period starts, the booking is non-refundable.
            </p>
            <p>
              From time to time, at Company’s sole discretion, Company may offer refunds outside of the cancellation policy.

              In the event that a Renter initiates a chargeback with their credit card company, for either rental fees or a security deposit, the Company will inform the Owner that a chargeback has been initiated. If Company deems that the chargeback is not warranted, Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to dispute the validity of the chargeback on the Owner’s behalf. Owner agrees to cooperate with the Company and to provide any information that may be reasonably requested by the Company in its investigation. If you are an Owner, you authorize the Company to share information about a chargeback with the Renter, the Renter’s financial institution, and Owner’s financial institution in order to investigate or mediate a chargeback. In the event that a chargeback dispute is lost, and funds are debited from Company’s account, Owner authorizes Company to, without notice, recapture such amount from Owner’s bank account or to withhold such amount from any payment due to Owner now or in the future. Owner acknowledges that chargeback decisions are made by the applicable issuing bank, card networks, or NACHA and all judgments as to the validity of the chargeback are made at the sole discretion of the applicable issuing bank, Card Networks, or NACHA.

              Under the Company’s Refer a Friend Program (the “Program”), Vancation Owners or Renters (each a “Referring Owner” or “Referring Renter”) may invite prospective owners or renters who are not currently Owners on Vancation.com or who have not previously rented with Vancation.com (each a “Referred Owner” or “Referred Renter”) to either create a Listing or rent an RV. Referring Owners, Referring Renters, Referred Owners and Referred Renters shall all be referred to as “Program Participants.”

              Once a Listing has been verified and the other conditions for payment (specified below) have occurred, the Referring Owner and the Referred Owner are eligible to receive a one-time “Referral Bonus” for travel credits on the Vancation platform and sometimes cash, in an amount established by the Company from time to time in its sole discretion.

              By participating in the Program, the Referred Owner acknowledges that the Company may at its sole discretion, share the Referred Owner’s first name and member status in the Referring Owner’s user account setting to inform the Referring Owner about the status of the earned Referral Bonus. If you do not want the Referring Owner to receive the information about you, please do not finalize your Listing after clicking on the Referral Link. Your participation in the Program will terminate and neither party will be eligible for a Referral Bonus.

              Company’s right to amend this Agreement, in whole or in part, does not apply to this “Disputes; Arbitration“ section. The version of this “Arbitration” section in effect on the date you last accepted the Agreement controls.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any and all claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except you may assert claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any claims you assert against us, our subsidiaries, users or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any claims that arose before you accepted the terms of this Agreement regardless of whether prior versions of the Agreement required arbitration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to beginning an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter describing your claims to the Company. If we have claims against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. If the parties are not able to resolve the matter, the party pursuing arbitration must file a case according to the rules set forth by the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Arbitrations will be conducted by the AAA under its rules, including the AAA Arbitration Consumer Rules (together, the “AAA Rules”). Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              You and Company acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable claims. You and Company acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all claims. Further, unless you and Company both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arbitration Hearing/Location. You agree that any required arbitration hearing will be conducted in either (a) Washoe County; (b) via phone or video conference; or (e) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.
